# PyBinaryStream
A C#-like binary stream python port.

Can be used to serialize/de-serialize primitive types over any byte stream (e.g. file, network stream, etc.)

Unlike the original C# code, this one natively supports big/little endiannes.

Written to practice my python skills, use at your own risk.
